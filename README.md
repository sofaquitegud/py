numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
Install them with:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Dataset: Place the car dataset (data.csv) in the same directory as the notebook. Adjust the file path in the notebook if necessary.
Running the Notebook: Open the notebook (eda.ipynb) and run each cell in sequence to complete the analysis.
Notebook Outline
Import Libraries: Essential libraries for data handling and visualization (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) are loaded.
Load Data: The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning:
Unnecessary columns are dropped to simplify analysis.
Columns are renamed for readability.
Duplicate rows are identified and removed to maintain data quality.
Data Exploration:
Displays initial and final rows to review data content.
Shows data types, shape, and identifies duplicates.
Summarizes key statistics to understand distributions and relationships within the data.
This notebook provides a comprehensive data exploration framework, making it easier to derive insights or prepare the data for further modeling.
